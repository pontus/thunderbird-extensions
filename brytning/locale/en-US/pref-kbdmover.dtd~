<!ENTITY textSuggestHelp "A comma seperated list that is searched left to right 
until a method is found that gives a possible completion.
Possible methods are last, senderX, receiverX (where X is the name of a test, 
see below), as well as a string within quotes (&quot;example&quot;) - this string 
will be used without any completion tests. last and &quot;string&quot; are always 
considered  successful, other methods if they are complete.
senderX and receiverX are only tested if just one mail is being moved (so KbdMover 
knows for which mail to look at the headers).
For senderX, the senders card is looked up in the and a test 
completion is done on the field X corresponds to. For 
receiverX the same is done for all To and CC-recipients 
(until there are no more or the test succeeds), so the suggested value may depend 
on the order the recipients are listed in.
<html:p/>X may be one of:
<html:ul>
<html:li>nick</html:li>
<html:li>category</html:li>
<html:li>company</html:li>
<html:li>screenname</html:li>
<html:li>custom1</html:li>
<html:li>custom2</html:li>
<html:li>custom3</html:li>

So, use senderworkcountry to try completion on the country field of the 
work adress in the senders address book card.">
